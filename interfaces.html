      <h2>How Design Nudges You</h2>
      <p>Have you ever noticed how some buttons on a website are super bright and easy to find, while others are kind of hidden or even grayed out? That’s not an accident. Designers do this on purpose to guide you toward certain choices. I used to think I was just clicking around, but now I realize the site is kind of steering me.</p>
      <p>There’s actually research on this. Tong and Chan (2023) talk about how interface design is used to get people to do what the site wants—like clicking “Accept” instead of “Decline.” Sometimes, you’ll see pop-ups or menus that make it way easier to go along with what the site wants, and way harder to say no (<a href="sources.html">Tong & Chan, 2023</a>).</p>
      <p>It’s not always a bad thing—sometimes it helps you find what you need. But it can also mean you’re not really making your own choices. If the “Decline” button is hidden or disabled, are you really choosing? Or are you just following the path they set up for you?</p>
      <blockquote>“Interface design is not neutral; it is a strategic tool to drive interactivity and digital engagement.”<br>— Tong, Suk Chong, and Fanny Fong Yee Chan (2023)</blockquote>
      <p>Here’s an example: check out the little box below. Notice how it’s way easier to accept than decline?</p>
      <div class="dark-pattern">
        <p>Do you accept our new privacy policy?</p>
        <button id="accept-btn">Accept</button>
        <button id="decline-btn" disabled>Decline</button>
        <span class="hint">(Decline is disabled—notice how your choice is limited!)</span>
      </div>
      <p>Stuff like this is everywhere online. Once you start looking for it, you’ll see it all the time.</p>
