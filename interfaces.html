      <h2>Persuasive Design and User Guidance</h2>
      <p>Every digital interaction is shaped by the interface: the arrangement of buttons, the prominence of certain options, and the subtle cues embedded in layouts and modals. These design choices are rarely neutral. For example, a brightly colored "Accept" button may draw the eye, while a "Decline" option is grayed out or hidden in a submenu. Such patterns are not accidental—they are crafted to guide user decisions in specific directions.</p>
      <p>According to Tong and Chan (2023), interface design is a strategic tool for driving interactivity and digital engagement. Their research highlights how practitioners use persuasive design to nudge users toward desired actions, often aligning user behavior with business goals. This can include everything from the placement of call-to-action buttons to the use of pop-up modals that interrupt user flow (<a href="sources.html">Tong & Chan, 2023</a>).</p>
      <p>While these techniques can enhance usability and engagement, they also raise ethical questions about user autonomy. When options are hidden, disabled, or visually minimized, users may feel compelled to follow the "preferred" path, sometimes without realizing their choices are being constrained. This dynamic is central to understanding how digital environments balance interactivity with control.</p>

      <p>Consider how some platforms make it easy to accept terms, but difficult to decline:</p>
      <div class="dark-pattern">
        <p>Do you accept our new privacy policy?</p>
        <button id="accept-btn">Accept</button>
        <button id="decline-btn" disabled>Decline</button>
        <span class="hint">(Decline is disabled—notice how your choice is limited!)</span>
      </div>
      <p>Such patterns subtly restrict user agency, making the "preferred" path the only viable option.</p>
