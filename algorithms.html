      <h2>How Algorithms Decide What You See</h2>
      <p>Let’s be real—most of us have no idea why we see certain posts, videos, or ads online. It feels random, but it’s not. There are algorithms working behind the scenes, picking what shows up and what gets buried. I used to think I was just seeing what was “popular” or “relevant,” but after digging in, I realized it’s way more complicated (and sometimes a little sneaky).</p>
      <p>These algorithms aren’t just technical stuff—they actually shape what you know, what you talk about, and even what you believe. Sometimes, they push stuff that gets more clicks or keeps you scrolling, even if it’s not the best for you. And honestly, a lot of the time, you don’t even know it’s happening.</p>
      <p>For example, researchers like Naheyan and others have shown that things like “dark patterns” and algorithmic curation can totally change your experience without you realizing it (<a href="sources.html">Naheyan et al., 2024</a>). If an algorithm wants you to see more ads, it’ll show you more stuff that makes you click. If it wants you to stay on the site, it’ll keep feeding you things you already agree with. That’s how you end up in a “bubble” where you only see one side of things.</p>
      <blockquote>“Dark patterns and algorithmic curation can shape user experience and decision-making, often without the user’s full awareness.”<br>— Naheyan, Tasneem, et al. (2024)</blockquote>
      <p>Want to see how this works? Click the button below. Sometimes posts will disappear or reappear, just like how algorithms can make stuff show up or vanish in your feed. It’s kind of weird, but it’s a good way to see how unpredictable things can get.</p>
      <div id="feed">
        <div class="post"><strong>Post 1 (Trending News):</strong> Trending news about digital rights</div>
        <div class="post"><strong>Post 2 (Community Update):</strong> Community update on platform changes</div>
        <div class="post"><strong>Post 3 (User Story):</strong> User story about algorithmic bias</div>
        <div class="post"><strong>Post 4 (Artistic Response):</strong> Artistic response to content moderation</div>
      </div>
      <button id="shuffle-btn" onclick="shuffleFeed()">Shuffle Feed</button>
      <p class="note">Every time you click, some posts might vanish and others might come back. That’s basically how algorithms mess with what you see online.</p>
      <p>So yeah, algorithms aren’t just math—they’re shaping your reality, sometimes in ways you don’t even notice.</p>
