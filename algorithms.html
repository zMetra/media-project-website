      <h2>Opacity, Curation, and Feedback Loops</h2>
      <p>Algorithms are the invisible hands that curate our digital experiences. From social media feeds to search results, these systems determine what content is surfaced and what remains hidden. The logic behind these decisions is often opaque, making it difficult for users to understand why they see certain posts or recommendations.</p>
      <p>This opacity is not just a technical issue—it has real consequences for user agency and knowledge. As Naheyan et al. (2024) note, algorithmic curation and dark patterns can shape user experience and decision-making, often without the user’s full awareness (<a href="sources.html">Naheyan et al., 2024</a>). When algorithms prioritize engagement or profit, they may reinforce existing biases, amplify sensational content, or silence minority voices.</p>
      <p>Algorithmic systems also create feedback loops: the more users interact with certain types of content, the more similar content is shown to them. This can lead to filter bubbles, where users are exposed only to information that aligns with their existing beliefs. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for navigating digital environments critically and responsibly.</p>
      <blockquote>“Dark patterns and algorithmic curation can shape user experience and decision-making, often without the user’s full awareness.”<br>— Naheyan, Tasneem, et al. (2024)</blockquote>
      <p>Click the button to see how algorithms might randomly hide or show content, simulating the unpredictability of algorithmic curation:</p>
      <div id="feed">
        <div class="post"><strong>Post 1 (Trending News):</strong> Trending news about digital rights</div>
        <div class="post"><strong>Post 2 (Community Update):</strong> Community update on platform changes</div>
        <div class="post"><strong>Post 3 (User Story):</strong> User story about algorithmic bias</div>
        <div class="post"><strong>Post 4 (Artistic Response):</strong> Artistic response to content moderation</div>
      </div>
      <button id="shuffle-btn" onclick="shuffleFeed()">Shuffle Feed</button>
      <p class="note">Each click simulates algorithmic unpredictability—some posts may vanish, others reappear. This illustrates how algorithmic systems can make some information visible and others invisible, shaping our perception of reality.</p>
      <p>Algorithmic bias and curation can reinforce certain narratives while silencing others, shaping our digital realities in subtle ways.</p>
