      <h2>Hey, Welcome!</h2>
      <p>If you’ve ever wondered how much control you really have online, you’re in the right place. I made this site to dig into how websites and apps make us feel like we’re in charge, but actually guide us in ways we don’t always notice. I’m not just talking about it—I’m showing it, so you can see for yourself how design and algorithms shape what you do.</p>
      <p class="thesis"><strong>My Main Point:</strong> Even though digital platforms say they’re all about giving you control, a lot of the power is actually hidden in the way things are designed and how algorithms work behind the scenes.</p>

      <ol>
        <li><a href="interfaces.html">Interfaces of Control</a>: I’ll show you how things like button placement and menu design can push you to act a certain way—even if you don’t realize it.</li>
        <li><a href="algorithms.html">Algorithmic Visibility</a>: Ever wonder why you see some stuff and not others? I’ll break down how algorithms decide what pops up and what gets hidden.</li>
        <li><a href="resistance.html">User Resistance</a>: It’s not all one-way! Here’s where I talk about how people (and designers) push back and find ways to take back some control.</li>
