    <h1>Interactivity and Control in Digital Environments</h1>
    <blockquote>“The medium is the message.” — Marshall McLuhan</blockquote>
    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Digital environments promise unprecedented interactivity, offering users the sense of agency and control. Yet, beneath the surface, the design of interfaces and the logic of algorithms often shape, guide, and sometimes limit our choices. This site explores how interactivity is constructed, how power is embedded in digital systems, and how users can both comply with and resist these structures.</p>
      <p class="thesis"><strong>Thesis:</strong> Although digital platforms claim to center user agency through interactivity, they often obscure how power is concentrated in algorithmic and interface design.</p>
