        <h1>Why a Website Was the Right Medium</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>I chose to create a website for my final project that took up the topic of interactivity and control in online environments. The project explores how user interfaces and algorithmic systems structure user conduct, often under the guise of choice or participation. The website was the ideal venue for expressing these ideas because it allowed me to demonstrate—not just describe—how computer systems allocate attention and interaction. With interactive design features (e.g., simulated dark patterns and algorithmically hidden content), I could interleave my argument within the user's flow. The result is a project both analytic and experiential, one that encourages visitors to reflect critically upon the very dynamics the site analyzes.</p>

        <h2>Why a Website?</h2>
        <p>Unlike a linear presentation or essay, a site allows users to search and interact with content in non-linear ways. This capability mirrors the design of much of the online spaces that the project is critiquing: spaces in which users perceive that they are searching and selecting independently, but in which their choices are significantly orchestrated by UI conventions and recommendation algorithms.</p>

        <p>With HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I was able to replicate features that are common in real digital contexts, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Disabled buttons guiding user choice (mimicking confusing interface design),</li>
            <li>Randomly appearing or disappearing content (mimicking algorithmic uncertainty), and</li>
            <li>Modular organization that encourages discovery (but also showing how interface boundaries curve and focus).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These forces would be impossible to replicate on paper. The site is not just about control—it enforces it.</p>

        <h2>Connection to Course Themes</h2>
        <p>This project positively addresses a number of the course issues, specifically how computer systems affect the agency, transparency, and control of users. In particular, Marshall McLuhan's idea that "the medium is the message" (in his book "Media Hot and Cold") is at the heart of the argument and the justification for the use of a website.</p>

        <p>McLuhan is interested in distinguishing between "hot" and "cool" media: hot media are of high definition and allow low participation, while cool media are of low definition and require active engagement. I come to the site as a cool medium—it requires the user to click, negotiate, and decode. But simultaneously, most of the digital environment that it is emulating is hot in McLuhan's sense: interfaces are tightly honed, options are bounded, and agency is circumscribed.</p>

        <p>By placing the user in this tension—engaging with a cool medium that imitates hot, autocratic systems—the site encourages them to reflect on their own conduct and expectations as digital citizens.</p>
