        <h1>Why I Picked a Website for This Project</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>So, for my final project, I decided to make a website. I wanted to talk about how we interact with stuff online and how much control we really have. If you’ve ever clicked around a site and felt like you had choices, but then realized you were kind of being steered in a certain direction, that’s exactly what I’m interested in. I thought a website was the best way to show this, not just talk about it. By actually letting you click around and see things change—like buttons that don’t work or content that randomly disappears—I could make my point in a way that’s way more real than just writing an essay. My goal was to make something you could experience, not just read about, so you’d start to notice these patterns in your own online life.</p>

        <h2>Why a Website?</h2>
        <p>If you’ve ever tried to learn something from a slideshow or a regular essay, you know it’s pretty much a straight line from start to finish. But a website? You can jump around, click what you want, and explore at your own pace. That’s actually a lot like how the internet works in real life. We think we’re making our own choices, but a lot of the time, the site’s design or some hidden algorithm is nudging us one way or another.</p>

        <p>With HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I could copy some of the tricks real websites use, like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Buttons that look like you can click them, but you actually can’t (which is honestly kind of annoying, but super common),</li>
            <li>Stuff that pops in and out randomly, so you’re never sure what you’ll see next, and</li>
            <li>Sections that are organized to make you want to keep clicking, but also show how the site is kind of guiding you.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Try doing that on paper—it just doesn’t work. This site isn’t just about control; it actually puts you in those situations.</p>

        <h2>How This Connects to the Class</h2>
        <p>All of this ties back to what we talked about in class: how computers and websites affect what we can do, what we see, and how much control we really have. There’s this idea from Marshall McLuhan—he’s the guy who said “the medium is the message”—and it’s basically the reason I went with a website. He talks about “hot” and “cool” media. Hot media are super clear and don’t need you to do much, while cool media are kind of fuzzy and make you participate more. I wanted my site to be a cool medium, where you have to click around and figure things out. But at the same time, most of the internet is actually pretty “hot”—it’s polished, your choices are limited, and you’re kind of boxed in.</p>

        <p>By putting you in the middle of this—using a site that’s supposed to be interactive, but also shows how your choices are shaped—I hope you’ll start to notice how these things work in the rest of your digital life. It’s not just about reading or watching; it’s about actually feeling what it’s like to be guided (or even controlled) by the design.</p>
