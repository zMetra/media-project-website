      <h2>Challenging Digital Control</h2>
      <blockquote>“Hot media are high-definition and low in participation. Cool media invite participation.”<br>— Marshall McLuhan, "Media Hot and Cold" (course reading)</blockquote>
      <p>McLuhan’s distinction between “hot” and “cool” media helps us understand the dynamics of resistance in digital environments. Hot media, like television or algorithmically curated feeds, offer high-definition, low-participation experiences. In contrast, cool media—platforms that invite user input, customization, and collaboration—foster greater agency and resistance to top-down control (<a href="sources.html">McLuhan, Media Hot and Cold</a>).</p>
      <p>Effective resistance often requires making digital environments “cooler.” This can mean building or seeking out platforms that encourage participation, transparency, and user-driven content. The IndieWeb movement, for example, promotes personal websites and open standards as alternatives to corporate social media, giving users more control over their data and online identity.</p>
      <p>Other strategies include using ad blockers to disrupt surveillance capitalism, content spoofing to confuse tracking algorithms, or designing alternative user interfaces that foreground user choice and privacy. Artistic interventions—like glitch art or creative misuse of platform features—can also expose the underlying logic of digital systems and inspire new forms of agency (<a href="sources.html">Manovich; Jenny Odell</a>).</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hashtag manipulation:</strong> Using trending tags to surface alternative narratives.</li>
        <li><strong>Alt-platforms:</strong> Migrating to or building new spaces with different values.</li>
        <li><strong>Glitch art:</strong> Artistic interventions that reveal or disrupt platform logic.</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>“The interface is not just a transparent window to data, but a filter, a code, actively shaping what can be seen and done.”<br>— Lev Manovich</blockquote>
      <p>Artists like Jenny Odell use creative subversion to question and reimagine digital environments, highlighting the potential for resistance and agency.</p>
