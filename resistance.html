      <blockquote>“Hot media are high-definition and low in participation. Cool media invite participation.”<br>— Marshall McLuhan, "Media Hot and Cold" (course reading)</blockquote>
      <p>So, here’s the thing: not everyone just goes along with what digital platforms want. There’s this idea from McLuhan about “hot” and “cool” media. Hot media (like TV or super-polished apps) don’t really let you do much—they just show you stuff. Cool media, on the other hand, make you get involved, click around, and actually participate (<a href="sources.html">McLuhan, Media Hot and Cold</a>).</p>
      <p>If you want to resist or take back some control, you’ve got options. Some people join movements like IndieWeb, where you make your own website and control your own data instead of just using big social media. Others use ad blockers, mess with algorithms, or even make art that “breaks” the usual way things work online. It’s all about making the digital world a little more “cool”—more open, more participatory, and less about just following the script.</p>
      <p>Here are a few ways people push back:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hashtag manipulation:</strong> Using trending tags to get new ideas out there.</li>
        <li><strong>Alt-platforms:</strong> Moving to or building new spaces that work differently.</li>
        <li><strong>Glitch art:</strong> Making creative stuff that messes with how platforms usually work.</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>“The interface is not just a transparent window to data, but a filter, a code, actively shaping what can be seen and done.”<br>— Lev Manovich</blockquote>
      <p>Artists like Jenny Odell use creative tricks to make us think twice about how digital spaces work, and to show us that we can do things differently if we want.</p>
